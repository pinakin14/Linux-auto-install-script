# Linux-auto-install-script
For ubuntu/Debian

Created by Pinakin Kale 

you need to change the permissions for the file to make it executable by doing:

sudo chmod +x (script name)

and then run it with:

./(script name)

Alternatively, you can directly bash the file using:
sudo bash (script name)

Thanks!
